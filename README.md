# HGT_identification_in_evol_exps
Scripts for HGT identification workflow.

This repository includes Python and R scripts used in the analysis of an evolution experiment with HGT. The project is in active development, and at the moment, the workflow is not fully automated. For that reason, though the entire workflow makes use of the Breseq pipeline for analysis of microbial populations (Deatherage and Barrick 2014), Breseq is not explicity called here.
